The extracted text must be directly related to the Physical Housing Quality context. Otherwise exclude it completely from the output and do not assign any rating to it. </Task> <Rating> Use this rating scale: {'1': 'Implicit mention or general statement without specific details.', '2': 'Explicit mention or detailed emphasis with specific examples.'}. </Rating> <Example> Here are examples for Physical Housing Quality context: 'The house seems to be in decent shape, though it may require some touch-ups.' - It is rated as 1. The mention of the house being in decent shape but needing touch-ups suggests a general statement about the structure without specific details, fitting a rating of 1.; 'Overall, the property is in fair condition with potential for improvements.' - It is rated as 1. Describing the property as having potential for improvements implies a broad assessment of quality, which aligns with an implicit mention.; 'The structure appears solid, but some areas might need attention.' - It is rated as 1. Noting that some areas might need attention provides a vague reference to the house's condition, justifying a rating of 1.; 'The property boasts a brand-new roof and recently installed energy-efficient windows, ensuring top-notch physical housing quality.' - It is rated as 2. The specific mention of a brand-new roof and energy-efficient windows provides clear examples of high-quality features, warranting a rating of 2.; 'Features high-quality hardwood flooring and freshly painted walls throughout.' - It is rated as 2. Highlighting high-quality hardwood flooring and freshly painted walls offers explicit details about the property's condition.; 'Equipped with modern appliances and a recently renovated kitchen.' - It is rated as 2. Mentioning modern appliances and a renovated kitchen gives unmistakable references to quality improvements, thus rated as 2. Please generate your own reasons for the rating: Must contain 'Why this text is related to Physical Housing Quality context', and 'Why it is rated as 1 or 2'. </Example> <Output> Provide your answer strictly in list format on a single line without any additional comments or explanations: [{'text': str, 'rating': int, 'reason': str}, {second}, {third}, ...] If no relevant mention is found, answer 'No relevant texts' only. </Output> <Explanation> Key explanations: {'text': 'The specific mention or example from the description that relates to the context.', 'rating': 'The level of emphasis placed on the context, rated 1 or 2.', 'reason': 'The justification for the assigned rating, explaining why the text was rated as such.'} </Explanation>\""

Situated between Court Street and Boerum Place, you will be within a stone's throw of the best amenities offered in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill and downtown Brooklyn. Every subway line is just a block away at Borough Hall, or enjoy a parking garage directly across the street for additional convenience.

      "Brooklyn townhouses have been a source of beauty and lasting value for generations, and now there's the perfect modern update. Be the first owner of this Move-in-Ready, Modern Two-Unit Townhouse, with Private Parking, and much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located on a tree-lined block with easy commuting access, The Townhouses on East 54th Street are six beautiful new two-unit homes (not condominiums) conveniently located on a serene tree-lined block with easy commuting access to everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "606 East 54th Street is a gorgeous home and features two exciting units: a massive owners' upper duplex (with 3 to 4 bedrooms and 2.5 baths), and an income-producing rental duplex (with 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms). Additionally, you have parking for multiple cars, an indoor garage and 3+ outdoor spaces including a rare private roof deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best of all, everything is brand new, move-in-ready, and virtually maintenance-free. The mechanical and finish package is absolutely everything you want in a home: floor-to-ceiling Pella brand windows, Mitsubishi heating and cooling, wide plank, solid oak flooring, and Bertazoni appliances. Each home provides the highest standard of safety and strength with fully sprinklered construction and reinforced concrete foundations with finished recreation rooms, and separate mechanical rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owners' unit is unlike anything you've seen, and exactly what you're looking for. You enter a classic full-floor living, dining, and kitchen, but the center features double height 20 ft ceilings and skylight making this room bright all year round. This one-of-a-kind living floor is book-ended by tall windows and a sliding glass door to the deck and private yard below. The kitchen features all Bertazoni Appliances including exterior venting gas range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upstairs, the owners' duplex features three bedrooms and two full baths. The primary suite with en suite bath even includes a private terrace from the bedroom. This floor also has a convenient side-by-side laundry, plus exclusive access to the roof deck accessible through an almost unbelievably beautiful skylight door. Another bedroom can be created if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower-duplex rental has three bathrooms, two bedrooms, and a flexible finished rec room. With this much space, it can rent for $2,550 per month (enough to pay for $530,000 of your mortgage!) This level has a garage too, perfect for parking, a work studio, or countless other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Townhouses on East 54th Street are equally distant from Kings County Hospital and Brooklyn College with exceptionally convenient commuting routes north into Queens and all points south along Kings Highway. Call or email today and don't miss the chance to truly love your home.\n",

      "- Description: Welcome to this this charming midcentury ranch style house in the Valleyheart Glen neighborhood, one of the most coveted pockets in Sherman Oaks. Available for the first time in over 50 years, this unique 3 bedroom 2 bathroom home is located on a sprawling 11,217 sf (quarter acre) corner lot! Opportunity abounds at this special property. Enter through a spacious iron-fenced front yard along a picturesque shrub-lined walkway. Upon entering the home, you'll be greeted by a light-filled front living room centered around a warm fireplace which flows seamlessly into the open concept dining area with corner windows. The adjacent kitchen features a newer dishwasher, vintage gas stove, plenty of storage, and a convenient breakfast nook. Pass through a Dutch door into the private family room - ideal for movies or game night. Off the family room are three bedrooms and two hall bathrooms, each updated while retaining their vintage character. Exit from the family room or kitchen to the extra large back yard. Featuring a brick and terra cotta tile patio under sail shades and a generous grassy area, there’s plenty of room for a pool or ADU! Adjacent to the backyard is the driveway that leads to the attached 2-car garage, which includes a washer and dryer and plenty of shelving and storage options. This is a fantastic location in a quiet, beautiful, tree-filled neighborhood - just blocks from shops and restaurants on Ventura Blvd and Westfield Fashion Square Mall, and right near Ralphs Fresh Fare, Whole Foods Market (two of them!), Trader Joe's, and so much more. Enjoy as-is with some TLC to add your personal touch and/or reimagine by expanding into a larger home. The possibilities are endless. Don't miss out! Properties like this just don't come along very often. This is a Trust Sale and court confirmation is NOT required. Seller financing is available.\n",

As soon as you walk in, you will see it all for yourself, starting with an open and welcoming floor plan with a gorgeous updated kitchen flowing into a large dining area, opening up a nice-sized family room with a cozy fireplace and tons of natural light. Let’s get back to the kitchen. You will see that no expense was spared when redoing this space, including newer appliances with a built-in microwave and state-of-the-art smart refrigerator showing off a gorgeous glass tile backsplash, quartz countertops with a great breakfast bar, custom cabinets giving you tons of space, and a laundry area with a full-sized washer and dryer (all appliances will be staying with the home). The primary bedroom offers plenty of space to relax, with 2 closets and a beautifully redone en-suite bathroom.  WOW, the backyard!  Can you say peaceful and wonderful with a combination of grass and hand-laid pavers, a relaxing seating area under the gazebo to enjoy those beautiful evenings. Currently, the garage has a small build-out room that can be used as an office, which is currently being used as a recording studio; the garage door is still functioning, and the buildout can be easily removed. We can’t forget to mention some of the other updates, including the roof and HVAC system, which are just over a year old. Also, a tankless water heater was installed about 4 years ago, with laminate floors, smoothed ceilings, and dual-pane windows throughout. The driveway has the potential for RV parking with the extended parking area and large side yard.

The large, 2 car garage offers direct access to the home, as well as even more storage that compliments the strategically placed storage throughout the home, designed specifically to meet today's standards and needs.

      "- Description: Welcome to this stylish mid-century modern home circa 1961 in Northridge. Offered for sale for only the second time in over 60 years, this rare gem is an entertainer's paradise and aesthetic dream. Set back from the street on a sprawling private lot with pool, this 4 BD/3 BA home abounds with charming vintage details and has been featured and published in many notable publications as a successful and profitable shoot location. The quintessential mid-century design is showcased in the main living spaces with clerestory windows, original fireplace and walls of glass letting in an abundance of natural light. Original storage closet room dividers, warm coffered wood ceilings, period-correct wallpaper and polished concrete floors are some of the many coveted period details still intact that blend beautifully with fun and practical modern updates in this time-tested layout. The bedroom wing is easily closed off to the main living space with pocket doors and features the primary suite with wood paneling and original tiled shower, as well as three other well-proportioned bedrooms with ample closet space, and additional bathrooms. An enclosed bonus space that the original owner used to cultivate his beloved orchid collection is now perfect for an office or home gym. Heading outside, you are instantly transported to a Palm Springs-like oasis with lush landscaping, mature palm trees and multiple zones for entertaining including the heated saltwater pool. A detached storage shed and detached garage offers unlimited potential to expand and transform this compound. Modern system upgrades include solar panels, a new roof, updated electrical, custom motorized window shades, and much more. Located moments away from both the Balboa Gifted/High-Ability Magnet Elementary School as well as the Highland Hall Waldorf School, and less than 20 miles from downtown Hollywood, this one-of-a-kind property is a rare find in a great Valley location.\n",

Gleaming hardwood floors greet you at the front door and span the entire residence. Step through the entry to find a graciously scaled sun-drenched living room with a handsome fireplace. Adjacent to the living room, handy pocket doors separate a built-in adorned home office that easily converts to a media room or fourth bedroom. Past the open concept dining room find a modern kitchen featuring new stainless appliances, ample storage, and a separate laundry room. Ascend the half flight of stairs to a primary suite boasting dual custom walk-in closets and an ensuite bathroom with dual vanities and an oversized steam shower. Two spacious bedrooms and a full bathroom with a separate shower and tub complete the interior. The second bedroom, living room and kitchen open to a backyard comprised of multiple spaces: whether it's dining under the pergola, roaming the verdant lawn, relaxing beneath the twinkle of stars in the hot tub, or taking in the view of the Verdugo mountains from the deck, your outdoor entertaining options are seemingly limitless. Highlights of a long list of upgrades include newer HVAC, double-pane windows with plantation shutters, a tankless water heater, and a Tesla charger in a full-size two-car garage. And while nestled in a quiet corner of the neighborhood, Eagle Rock's buzzy haunts -- Colorado Donuts, Capri Club, The Oinkster, and Casa Bianca, to name a few -- are all located in close proximity.\n",

      "- Description: It is rare to find a residential property that is a combination of: a) charming, b) in a great location and c) has a permitted guest cottage that yields great income. The cottage is  sufficiently remote from the main house that an owner can happily enjoy the main house and not feel impinged upon by the resident in the guest cottage. This 300 sq ft guest unit - vacated in preparation for this sale - has for years been getting $2000/mo in income. There are also approved plans, if a new owner desires to execute them,  to join the existing cottage with the nearby garage, and thus double its size.  As for the main house itself, it is quite charming and comfortable, with lots of upgrades, including new roof, new windows, newly bolted and anchored foundation and fairly new AC/heat system. The home is perfect for a couple just starting a family, with its master bedroom with ensuite bathroom and lots of closet space, and an additional full bathroom for guests as well as for the second bedroom. You also have a sizable entertainer's back yard, with good-sized chef's kitchen.  Not to mention a lovely fireplace in the living room. And, a long driveway that allows for plenty of off street parking. And, of course one can always convert the structure at the end of the driveway back to the garage it originally was. As for location, this property is located in the best part of the highly coveted Atwater Village - south of Los Feliz Blvd and north of Glendale Blvd, with all its popular shops and restaurants along Los Feliz and Glendale Blvd, including a great farmer's market every Sunday that is walking distance from this house. Bottom line - this home offers pretty much everything you would need and want at an affordable price, which of course becomes all the more so with the guest cottage bringing in $2000/mo to defray the mortgage. Come make it yours!\n",
